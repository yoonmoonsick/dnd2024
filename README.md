>Sequestered in high mountains and atop tall trees, the aarakocra—sometimes called birdfolk—evoke both fear and wonder. Many aarakocra are not even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond: the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, with their outposts serving as footholds in a world both strange and alien.

- Level 1
  - As a descendant of the Aarakocra, you gain the ability to fly. You can use this flying speed only while not wearing medium or heavy armor. Your base walking speed becomes 25ft per turn, and your body is considered light in weight.

![](https://i.imgur.com/s3dE2kW.png)

Choose **Aasimar** from the list of **Versatile** passives available to **Humans**.

>Aasimar are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. Whether descended from an angelic being or infused with celestial power, they can fan that spark to bring light, healing, and heavenly fury.
>
>Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and have features that hint at their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles, luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin color of an angel (silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These features start subtle and become obvious when the aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.

On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character Levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

>
> Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants.

>Monks of the Way of the Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons. A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.

>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.
>
>Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins — called hell knights — as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.

> 
> Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence.

> A well-placed bullet is more powerful than a sword, arrow, or spell. Indeed, you believe that every violent conflict should sound like a single loud crack followed by a long silence. Such shots demand perfection, even at range, for when they are done right, they are as deadly for the target as they are stupendous for the audience.

- Level 3: Eagle Eye ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_EagleEye.png?raw=true)

> Fortune is a fickle thing—unless you're a High Roller. These Gunslingers are master card sharps and dice throwers that mix their love of risk with their talent for gunplay. High Rollers push their luck until it runs out, then push harder. Why settle for a win when you could bet it all and win big?

- Level 3: Poker Face ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_RiskyBusiness.png?raw=true)

> Magic and guns aren't so different—arcane power is like gunpowder, a spell is like a bullet, and you are like a gun, directing your spells with precision at unfortunate targets. Spellslingers mix the disciplines of gunplay and spellcasting, sometimes loading arcane charges with your shots and firing bullets enhanced with lighting, frost, or flame.

- Level 3: Bang, You're Dead!
  - You learn the Finger Guns. When you hit a target with a Finger Guns attack, you can expend one Risk Die as a Bonus Action and add it to the damage roll.

> Accuracy means different things to different people. For you, true accuracy isn't necessarily in hitting a target on the first shot, but might include hitting the mark after the bullet bounces around a dozen times. Your attacks are just as dangerous if they miss, or even after hitting their mark, as others' are while they're still in the air.

- Level 3: Creative Trajectory
  - Your ranged weapon attacks are not penalized for High Ground Rules.
- Level 3: Ricochet ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_Ricochet.png?raw=true)

> Some Gunslingers live by a code and expect others to do the same. These Gunslingers, known as White Hats, sometimes serve as officers of the law but never hesitate to do what's right when the law says otherwise. Despite their affinity for deadly weapons, White Hats prefer to keep their friends safe and subdue their enemies nonviolently—a preference their enemies don't often oblige.

- Level 3: Lay Down the Law ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_LayDowntheLaw.png?raw=true)
  - You can take a Bonus Action and expend one Risk Die to keep an eye out for dangers that threaten your companions. Choose an ally that you can see within 60 feet of you.

- Level 3: Steely-Eyed Aura

- Level 10: Long Arm of the Law
  - Once per turn, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can hobble the target. The creature can't move on its next turn.

>The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme endlessly. Each eternally plots to bring the others to heel—to ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the Seven Cities and every infernal being living there, and lead an inexhaustible army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.
>
>These archdevils' elite operatives are the illriggers. Knights, assassins, mages, and terror-commandos of Hell, illriggers command the battlefield, disrupt enemy factions, and carry out their archdevil's infernal will.

- Level 1: Baleful Interdict ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Resources/1_Normal_48/IllriggerSeal.png?raw=true)

  - You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels.
  - If an interdicted creature dies, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move all seals placed on them to a new creature you can see within 30 feet of them.
  - Burning Seals
    - You can burn a seal you placed on them to deal 1d6 fire or necrotic damage (your choice) to that creature per seal burned. You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage. Burning a seal doesn't require an action from you, but you can't do so while incapacitated. Once a seal is burned, it immediately vanishes.
  - Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6. The damage of each seal increases again by 1d6 when you reach 10th level for a total of 3d6.
- Level 2: Combat Mastery

    - When you use your Baleful Interdict to place or burn a seal, its range is 60 feet instead of 30 feet.

In addition, making a ranged attack while within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
- Level 2: Interdiction
  - You can infuse your seals with hellish magical power, enhancing their effects.
  - Abating Seal
    - When a creature you can see damages you or an ally within 30 feet of you, you can expend a seal as a reaction to reduce the damage taken by the target by an amount equal to 1d10 + half of your illrigger level (rounded down).

  - Your diabolic connection allows you to channel infernal energy to empower magical effects. Your chosen diabolic contract grants you two Invoke Hell options and describes how to use each.
  - You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a short rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach Illrigger Level 11, you gain 1 additional use of this feature.  - Some Invoke Hell effects require a saving throw. When you use such an effect, the DC equals your interdict save DC.
- Level 5: Extra Attack
- Level 6: Infernal Conduit ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Resources/1_Normal_48/InfernalConduitDie.png?raw=true)
  - You can strengthen your allies at the cost of yourself—or drain your enemy's life force for your own gain. You have a pool of Infernal Conduit dice, which are d10s. The number of Infernal Conduit dice in your pool increase as you gain illrigger levels, as shown in the Infernal Conduit Dice column of the Illrigger table.
  - As an action, you can touch another creature and spend one or more dice from your pool. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your interdict save DC. A creature can willingly fail this saving throw. Roll the spent dice and choose one of the following effects:

      - On a failed save, the target regains hit points equal to the total you rolled, and you take necrotic damage equal to that total. On a successful save, the target regains half as many hit points, and you take necrotic damage equal to that total. Save or fail, this necrotic damage can't be reduced in any way, and if this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious and are stabilized.
    - Devour ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_InfernalConduit_Devour.png?raw=true)
      - On a failed save, the target takes necrotic damage equal to the total you rolled, and you regain hit points equal to that total. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you regain hit points equal to the damage the target took. Save or fail, or if the target chose to fail their saving throw against this effect, the necrotic damage can't be reduced in any way. When you reach 11th level in this class, the target also gains a level of exhaustion on a failed save against this effect. This level of exhaustion can be reduced as normal, and a creature can't suffer more than three levels of exhaustion combined from all illriggers' Infernal Conduit features.

Each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes the same amount and type of damage as the seals dealt to the interdicted creature. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
  - Vengeful Shot
    - When a creature makes a ranged attack against you or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you, you can expend a seal as a reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the attacker. If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to half your illrigger level (rounded down).

>Architects of Ruin are cool and calculating arcane knights who serve Asmodeus, deploying spells, steel, and subterfuge to win at any cost.
>
>Asmodeus rules Acheron, the City of Fear. His illriggers scour the timescape, collecting secrets and spells designed to deceive and terrify his opponents. The war he fights against the other archdevils is one of deception and information.
>
>His Architects of Ruin work to make Hell's enemies seem outnumbered and outmaneuvered. These illriggers are skillful spellblades on the battlefield, though some employ tactics such as research, infiltration, and propaganda to play mind games with their quarry. When an Architect of Ruin finally confronts an enemy, the advantage is theirs—they have studied, prepared, and gripped fate within their gauntlet, forcing it to favor them. They hungrily seek the dark arts to arm both themselves and Asmodeus with the impossible.

- Level 3: Spellcasting (1/3 Caster)

![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/ClassIcons/2_hotbar_140/Hellspeaker.png?raw=true)

>The charismatic and manipulative Hellspeakers serve Moloch as they slip about the battlefield, coercing enemies into becoming unwitting allies.
>
>Moloch rules Styx, the City of Lies, but his reach extends far beyond it. Hell's greatest politicians and diplomats rise to prominence through Moloch's subtle manipulations. They follow him with great loyalty, for they know they are nothing without him—and thus his power echoes through all of Hell.
>
>Moloch's illriggers are silver-tongued enchanters, lulling his foes to complacency with sorcery and subterfuge until they wake and find themselves under the command of the Order of Desolation. These Hellspeakers train in the art known as the Red Cant or Hell's Cant. By understanding their enemy and through weaving subtle sorceries into normal speech, Hellspeakers can make their foes feel, think, or do nearly anything to accelerate Hell's victory.
>
>Across the timescape, Hellspeakers enjoy a reputation as smiling rogues and swashbuckling villains. An asset in any negotiation, Hellspeakers know that in a world of lies, the truth can be as potent a weapon as steel.

- Level 11: Let's Make a Deal ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_LetsMakeADeal.png?raw=true)
  - As a bonus action, you can offer a willing ally within 60 feet a deal. Within the next 10 minutes, they gain advantage on one attack roll or saving throw. After using this effect, there is a 50% chance they receive a blessing, gaining 12 temporary hit points, or a curse, suffering disadvantage on their next attack roll or saving throw.

### Painkiller

![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/ClassIcons/2_hotbar_140/Painkiller.png?raw=true)

>The heavily armored death troopers of Hell, Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.
>
>Dispater rules Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater's army does the fighting and dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. The imperious Painkillers are full of pride and hubris, and they often obsess over their personal appearance.
>
>Though among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, a Painkiller's gallantry is twisted. They accept and honor challenges to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere—but if losing, they don't hesitate to cheat, and if winning, they arrogantly toy with an enemy before finishing them.
>
>In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another world might see their army facing certain defeat and call on Dispater. Ever eager to sow strife and discord, Dispater often responds to these pleas by sending a Painkiller to lead the desperate ruler's armies.

- Level 3: Dispater's Blessing
  - When Dispater accepts you as his illrigger, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.
- Level 3: Devastator ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_Devastator.png?raw=true)

  - Grand Strategist ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_GrandStrategistt.png?raw=true)

  - When a creature you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to place a seal on them. When you do, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be either pushed back 15 feet.
- Level 11: You Die on My Command! ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_YouDieOnMyCommand.png?raw=true)

### Sanguine Knight

![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/ClassIcons/2_hotbar_140/SanguineKnight.png?raw=true)

>The blood-knights of Hell, Sanguine Knights serve Sutekh, Lord of Blood. Their sorceries drain their enemies' life force, pouring this stolen vitality into infernal rituals to turn the tide of battle.
>
>Sutekh rules Naraka, the City of Blood. Recognized as the greatest sorcerer in hell, he carries the title of High Sanguinary and rules from the Temple of Vitality. He is a master of blood magic, and his inner circle of priests and wizards are the Bloodliches, undead spellcasters whose corporeal forms turned to ash centuries ago and whose bodies are crafted from solid blood.
>
>Sutekh's illriggers all belong to a cult known as the Chalice of Vitality. Knights of the Chalice drink deeply of their enemies' essence, draining it to power their magics. Other members of the Order of Desecration fear that the Sanguine Knights seek more than Sutekh's mere ascension to the Throne of Hell; some whisper that the Chalice secretly schemes to make Sutekh a god. This would, of course, be treason.

- Level 3: Sutekh's Blessing
  - When Sutekh accepts you as his illrigger, he grants you access to his sacrilegious command of blood and life. You gain expertise in the Religion skill.
- Level 3: Exsanguinate ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_Exsanguinate.png?raw=true)
  - You can drain enemies to embolden your allies. Whenever you burn one or more seals on a creature, you can choose an ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt by the seals to the interdicted creature.
- Level 3: Invoke Hell ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Resources/1_Normal_48/InvokeHellCharge.png?raw=true)
  - Embolden Allies
    - As a bonus action, you restore a total number of hit points equal to five times your illrigger level, divided however you choose between yourself and other creatures within 30 feet of you.
  - Vitalize
    - You can flood your allies with invigorating vivacity (no action required). For 1 minute, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you gains advantage on all ability checks.
- Level 7: Foul Interchange
  - As an action, you choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you and expend a seal to end one of the following conditions affecting them: blinded, charmed, dazed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Then, you choose another creature within 60 feet of you, which must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer a random condition until the start of your next turn.
- Level 11: Bloodstroke ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Illrigger_Bloodstroke.png?raw=true)
  - The magic that shields your allies now also saps their enemies' strength. When an ally who has temporary hit points from your Exsanguinate feature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 11 necrotic damage.

### Shadowmaster

![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/ClassIcons/2_hotbar_140/Shadowmaster.png?raw=true)

>Belial rules Gehennom, the City of Darkness. He strives to rule Hell through poison, torture, and assassination. His illriggers strike from the shadows or use deception to earn high-ranking positions close to powerful rulers. Many Shadowmasters run networks of spies and assassins who have no idea of the infernal provenance of their leader.
>
>Shadowmasters are sworn not to reveal their true allegiance, and if need be, they must take their own lives to fulfill this oath. Many Shadowmasters prepare elaborate plans for their own assassination so that, should they risk discovery, their assassination obscures the truth. Of course, these killers never learn they were hired by their deceased target.

- Level 3: Marked for Death
  - You are particularly skilled against foes you mark for death. You have advantage on your first attack against an interdicted creature on each of your turns.
- Level 3: Strike from the Dark
  - You understand the power of striking from the shadows. Once per turn, when you hit an interdicted creature with a melee weapon attack and you have advantage on the attack roll, you can roll a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus and deal extra damage equal to the total you rolled. This damage increases by 1d4 if the target is in dim light or darkness.
- Level 3: Invoke Hell ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Resources/1_Normal_48/InvokeHellCharge.png?raw=true)
  - Master of Disguise
    - As an action, you can cast the disguise self spell without expending a spell slot.
  - No Escape
    - As a bonus action, you can call upon the shadows to entrap a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw, with disadvantage if they are in dim light or darkness. On a failed save, the target is slowed. This effect ends if you are incapacitated, die, or if the target moves more than 30 feet away from you.
- Level 7: Veil of Lies
  - As a bonus action, you can expend a seal to become invisible for 10 minutes or until you attack or cast a spell.
- Level 11: Umbral Killer
  - Shadows enhance your abilities, granting you Devil's Sight, an additional 10 feet of movement speed, and advantage on Stealth checks. Additionally, when making a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, you instead take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
