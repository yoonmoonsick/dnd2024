![](https://i.imgur.com/q7ZAlD6.png)

Choose **Aarakocra** from the list of **Versatile** passives available to **Humans**.

>Sequestered in high mountains and atop tall trees, the aarakocra—sometimes called birdfolk—evoke both fear and wonder. Many aarakocra are not even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond: the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, with their outposts serving as footholds in a world both strange and alien.

- Level 1
  - As a descendant of the Aarakocra, you gain the ability to fly. You can use this flying speed only while not wearing medium or heavy armor. Your base walking speed becomes 25ft per turn, and your body is considered light in weight.

>
>Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and have features that hint at their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles, luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin color of an angel (silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These features start subtle and become obvious when the aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.

>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.
>
>Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins — called hell knights — as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.

Either way, a scion's power manifests as various occult gifts, as well as an uncanny talent for striking and terrifying foes.

Underground cults to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul often count Scions of the Three among their most useful agents.

> An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?
> 
> Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole's psionic power is yours.

> The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March.

> A well-placed bullet is more powerful than a sword, arrow, or spell. Indeed, you believe that every violent conflict should sound like a single loud crack followed by a long silence. Such shots demand perfection, even at range, for when they are done right, they are as deadly for the target as they are stupendous for the audience.

High Rollers push their luck until it runs out, then push harder. Why settle for a win when you could bet it all and win big?

- Level 3: Poker Face ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_PokerFace.png?raw=true)

> Magic and guns aren't so different—arcane power is like gunpowder, a spell is like a bullet, and you are like a gun, directing your spells with precision at unfortunate targets. Spellslingers mix the disciplines of gunplay and spellcasting, sometimes loading arcane charges with your shots and firing bullets enhanced with lighting, frost, or flame.

- Level 3: Bang, You're Dead! ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_BangYouAreDead.png?raw=true)

> Accuracy means different things to different people. For you, true accuracy isn't necessarily in hitting a target on the first shot, but might include hitting the mark after the bullet bounces around a dozen times. Your attacks are just as dangerous if they miss, or even after hitting their mark, as others' are while they're still in the air.

- Level 3: Creative Trajectory
  - Your ranged weapon attacks are not penalized for High Ground Rules.
- Level 3: Ricochet ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_Ricochet.png?raw=true)

> Some Gunslingers live by a code and expect others to do the same. These Gunslingers, known as White Hats, sometimes serve as officers of the law but never hesitate to do what's right when the law says otherwise. Despite their affinity for deadly weapons, White Hats prefer to keep their friends safe and subdue their enemies nonviolently—a preference their enemies don't often oblige.

- Level 3: Lay Down the Law ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Skills/4_Readme_48/Gunslinger_LayDowntheLaw.png?raw=true)

>The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme endlessly. Each eternally plots to bring the others to heel—to ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the Seven Cities and every infernal being living there, and lead an inexhaustible army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.
>
>These archdevils' elite operatives are the illriggers. Knights, assassins, mages, and terror-commandos of Hell, illriggers command the battlefield, disrupt enemy factions, and carry out their archdevil's infernal will.

- Level 1: Baleful Interdict ![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/Resources/1_Normal_48/IllriggerSeal.png?raw=true)
  - You gain the ability to censure creatures with the power of Hell. Once on your turn, you can place a magical seal on a creature within 30 feet of you.

  - You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels.

    - You can burn a seal you placed on them to deal 1d6 fire or necrotic damage (your choice) to that creature per seal burned. You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage.

  - Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6. The damage of each seal increases again by 1d6 when you reach 10th level for a total of 3d6.

      - On a failed save, the target takes necrotic damage equal to the total you rolled, and you regain hit points equal to that total.

>
>His Architects of Ruin work to make Hell's enemies seem outnumbered and outmaneuvered. These illriggers are skillful spellblades on the battlefield, though some employ tactics such as research, infiltration, and propaganda to play mind games with their quarry. When an Architect of Ruin finally confronts an enemy, the advantage is theirs—they have studied, prepared, and gripped fate within their gauntlet, forcing it to favor them. They hungrily seek the dark arts to arm both themselves and Asmodeus with the impossible.

They follow him with great loyalty, for they know they are nothing without him—and thus his power echoes through all of Hell.
>
>Moloch's illriggers are silver-tongued enchanters, lulling his foes to complacency with sorcery and subterfuge until they wake and find themselves under the command of the Order of Desolation. These Hellspeakers train in the art known as the Red Cant or Hell's Cant. By understanding their enemy and through weaving subtle sorceries into normal speech, Hellspeakers can make their foes feel, think, or do nearly anything to accelerate Hell's victory.

>The heavily armored death troopers of Hell, Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.
>
>Dispater rules Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater's army does the fighting and dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. The imperious Painkillers are full of pride and hubris, and they often obsess over their personal appearance.
>
>Though among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, a Painkiller's gallantry is twisted. They accept and honor challenges to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere—but if losing, they don't hesitate to cheat, and if winning, they arrogantly toy with an enemy before finishing them.

>The blood-knights of Hell, Sanguine Knights serve Sutekh, Lord of Blood. Their sorceries drain their enemies' life force, pouring this stolen vitality into infernal rituals to turn the tide of battle.
>
>Sutekh rules Naraka, the City of Blood. Recognized as the greatest sorcerer in hell, he carries the title of High Sanguinary and rules from the Temple of Vitality.

>
>Sutekh's illriggers all belong to a cult known as the Chalice of Vitality. Knights of the Chalice drink deeply of their enemies' essence, draining it to power their magics. Other members of the Order of Desecration fear that the Sanguine Knights seek more than Sutekh's mere ascension to the Throne of Hell; some whisper that the Chalice secretly schemes to make Sutekh a god. This would, of course, be treason.

# Items
- Similar to other changes, the effects of equipment items have been adjusted.
- Fixed known bugs related to certain equipment items.
- Items that previously existed only as dummy data can now be obtained from merchants, treasure chests, and loot during Acts I and III.

## Ability Score Item Rebalance

Some items in Baldur's Gate 3 that set an ability score to a fixed number (override) have been changed to provide a stat bonus instead. This adjustment was made to prevent the homogenization of "stat-dumping" builds, which became overly powerful when combined with the flexible respec system. The goal of this balance change is to preserve the value of character growth through leveling, broaden the scope of viable item choices, and encourage players to enjoy building more diverse and unique characters.

## Firearms
- Firearms don't add your ability modifier to damage rolls. If you're not proficient with firearms, you deal half damage when using them.
- Characters proficient with firearms deal full damage when using them.
- Firearm Proficiency can be obtained through:
  - The Artificer or Gunslinger class (including multiclassing).
  - The Firearm Specialist Feat.
- You can buy firearms from weapon traders. The kinds of firearms they have will diversify as your party level increases.

## Spell Scroll Restrictions

The use of spell scrolls is restricted based on class. This change is intended to prevent situations where a Barbarian with 8 Intelligence, 8 Wisdom, and 8 Charisma can repeatedly spam Scrolls of Chain Lightning. We hope this adjustment has a positive impact on the overall gameplay experience.
These restrictions are less strict than those found in the original ruleset. However, additional limitations based on spell level may be introduced in the future.
The list below details which classes can use each spell scroll.
At present, full scroll access granted by subclasses has not yet been implemented. As an exception, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, Spellslinger, and Architect of Ruin are allowed to use Wizard spell scrolls.
