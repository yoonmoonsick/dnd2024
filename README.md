## ![](https://i.imgur.com/s3dE2kW.png) Aasimar

Choose **Aasimar** from the list of **Versatile** passives available to **Humans**.

>Aasimar are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. Whether descended from an angelic being or infused with celestial power, they can fan that spark to bring light, healing, and heavenly fury.
>
>Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and have features that hint at their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles, luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin color of an angel (silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These features start subtle and become obvious when the aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.

You have Resistance to Necrotic and Radiant damage, Darkvision, can cast the Light cantrip, use Healing Hands.

Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character Levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

> 
> Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants.

>The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme endlessly. Each eternally plots to bring the others to heel—to ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the Seven Cities and every infernal being living there, and lead an inexhaustible army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.
>
>These archdevils’ elite operatives are the illriggers. Knights, assassins, mages, and terror-commandos of Hell, illriggers command the battlefield, disrupt enemy factions, and carry out their archdevil’s infernal will.

#### Level 1: Baleful Interdict

You gain the ability to censure creatures with the power of Hell.

![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/SkillIconsBG%2064/Spell_Illrigger_BurningSeals.png?raw=true)

You gain the ability to censure creatures with the power of Hell. Once on your turn, you can place a magical seal on a creature within 30 feet of you. You can either place this seal when you hit that target with a weapon attack (no action required), or you can use a bonus action to place this seal on a target you can see within range. This seal lasts for 1 minute or until burned (see "Burning Seals" below). A creature with one or more of your seals is referred to as an interdicted creature. Seals you place are invisible to other creatures, and when you can see an interdicted creature, the seals appear to you as glowing glyphs on the creature’s body.

You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels, as indicated in the Seals column of the Illrigger table.

If an interdicted creature dies, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move all seals placed on them to a new creature you can see within 30 feet of them. Each seal’s duration continues to elapse when an interdicted creature dies and when that seal is moved to a new creature.

Burning Seals. When an interdicted creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from any source other than a seal burned by an illrigger, you can burn any number of seals you placed on them to deal 1d6 fire or necrotic damage (your choice) to that creature per seal burned. You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage. Burning a seal doesn’t require an action from you, but you can’t do so while incapacitated. Once a seal is burned, it immediately vanishes.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6. The damage of each seal increases again by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (for a total of 3d6) and 20th level (for a total of 4d6) in this class, as indicated in the Seal Damage column of the Illrigger table.

#### Level 2: Combat Mastery

Your archdevil grants you uncanny skill in a certain form of combat. Choose one of the following illrigger combat masteries:

- **Bravado**: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
- **Brutal**: Once per turn, when you hit a creature who is no more than one size larger than you with an attack you make with a melee weapon you are wielding with two hands, you can move the target 5 feet horizontally.
- **Inexorable**: You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws for each hostile creature within 5 feet of you, to a maximum bonus of +5.
- **Lies**: When you attack with a melee weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
- **Lissome**: When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can move without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Unfettered**: When you use your Baleful Interdict to place or burn a seal, its range is 60 feet instead of 30 feet. When you gain the Infernal Conduit feature at 6th level, its range is 30 feet instead of touch. In addition, making a ranged attack while within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### Level 2: Interdiction

You can infuse your seals with hellish magical power, enhancing their effects.

**Interdict Boons Known**. You learn one interdict boon of your choice from the “Interdict Boons” section at the end of the class’s description. As you gain levels in this class, you gain additional boons of your choice, as shown in the Interdict Boons column of the Illrigger table. Each new boon must be of a level you can learn. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn one new boon of 2nd or 7th level.
- **2nd-Level Interdict Boons**: You can choose from these boons when you gain the Interdiction feature at 2nd level, or whenever you gain a new boon.
  - **Abating Seal**: When a creature you can see damages you or an ally within 30 feet of you, you can expend a seal as a reaction to reduce the damage taken by the target by an amount equal to 1d10 + half of your illrigger level (rounded down).
  - **Bedevil**: When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can activate this boon (no action required). The target must subtract a number equal to your proficiency bonus from the result of the next saving throw they make before the end of their next turn.
  - **Soul Eater**: When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can activate this boon (no action required) to regain hit points equal to your illrigger level.
  - **Styx’s Apathy**: When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can use your reaction to flood the target with an otherworldly chill. Until the end of the target’s next turn, they can’t take reactions.
  - **Swift Retribution (Passive)**: When an interdicted creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can make that attack without using your reaction, provided you’re not incapacitated. Once you benefit from this boon, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.
- **7th-Level Interdict Boons**: When you reach 7th level, the following interdict boons are added to your list of Interdiction options.
  - **Acheron’s Chain**: When you use a bonus action to place or move a seal on a Large or smaller creature, you can activate this boon (no action required). You conjure infernal chains to grasp the target, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can cause them to be restrained until the end of your next turn (escape DC equal to your interdict save DC).
  - **Conflagrant Channel**: You can expend a seal as a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
  - **Shadow Shroud**: You can expend a seal as a bonus action to weave a mantle of semisolid shadows around yourself or a creature you touch. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC for 1 minute.
  - **Unleash Hell**: When you burn one or more seals on an interdicted creature, you can use your reaction to unleash an explosion of hellish energy around them. Each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes the same amount and type of damage as the seals dealt to the interdicted creature. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
  - **Vengeful Shot**: When a creature makes a ranged attack against you or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you, you can expend a seal as a reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the attacker. If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to half your illrigger level (rounded down).

#### Level 3: Invoke Hell

![](https://github.com/yoonmoonsick/dnd2024/blob/master/%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%98/ActionResources_c%2080/InvokeHellCharge.png?raw=true)

Your diabolic connection allows you to channel infernal energy to empower magical effects. Your chosen diabolic contract grants you two Invoke Hell options and describes how to use each.

When you use your Invoke Hell, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Invoke Hell again.

Some Invoke Hell effects require a saving throw. When you use such an effect, the DC equals your interdict save DC.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

#### Level 6: Infernal Conduit

You can strengthen your allies at the cost of yourself—or drain your enemy’s life force for your own gain. You have a pool of Infernal Conduit dice, which are d10s. The number of Infernal Conduit dice in your pool increase as you gain illrigger levels, as shown in the Infernal Conduit Dice column of the Illrigger table.

As an action, you can touch another creature and spend one or more dice from your pool. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your interdict save DC. A creature can willingly fail this saving throw. Roll the spent dice and choose one of the following effects:

Invigorate. On a failed save, the target regains hit points equal to the total you rolled, and you take necrotic damage equal to that total. On a successful save, the target regains half as many hit points, and you take necrotic damage equal to that total. Save or fail, this necrotic damage can’t be reduced in any way, and if this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious and are stabilized.

Devour. On a failed save, the target takes necrotic damage equal to the total you rolled, and you regain hit points equal to that total. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you regain hit points equal to the damage the target took. Save or fail, or if the target chose to fail their saving throw against this effect, the necrotic damage can’t be reduced in any way. When you reach 11th level in this class, the target also gains a level of exhaustion on a failed save against this effect. This level of exhaustion can be reduced as normal, and a creature can’t suffer more than three levels of exhaustion combined from all illriggers’ Infernal Conduit features.

You regain any spent Infernal Conduit dice when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 10: Blood Price

You can strengthen your defenses at the cost of your vitality. Whenever you fail a saving throw, you can spend one of your Hit Dice, rolling it and adding the number rolled to the result of the save.

#### Level 11: Terrorizing Force

Your attacks are empowered with devastating might. When you gain this feature, choose a damage type: cold, fire, necrotic, or poison. When you hit with a weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the chosen type.

>Architects of Ruin are cool and calculating arcane knights who serve Asmodeus, deploying spells, steel, and subterfuge to win at any cost.
>
>Asmodeus rules Acheron, the City of Fear. His illriggers scour the timescape, collecting secrets and spells designed to deceive and terrify his opponents. The war he fights against the other archdevils is one of deception and information.
>
>His Architects of Ruin work to make Hell’s enemies seem outnumbered and outmaneuvered. These illriggers are skillful spellblades on the battlefield, though some employ tactics such as research, infiltration, and propaganda to play mind games with their quarry. When an Architect of Ruin finally confronts an enemy, the advantage is theirs—they have studied, prepared, and gripped fate within their gauntlet, forcing it to favor them.

>The charismatic and manipulative Hellspeakers serve Moloch as they slip about the battlefield, coercing enemies into becoming unwitting allies.
>
>Moloch rules Styx, the City of Lies, but his reach extends far beyond it. Hell’s greatest politicians and diplomats rise to prominence through Moloch’s subtle manipulations. They follow him with great loyalty, for they know they are nothing without him—and thus his power echoes through all of Hell.
>
>Moloch’s illriggers are silver-tongued enchanters, lulling his foes to complacency with sorcery and subterfuge until they wake and find themselves under the command of the Order of Desolation. These Hellspeakers train in the art known as the Red Cant or Hell’s Cant. By understanding their enemy and through weaving subtle sorceries into normal speech, Hellspeakers can make their foes feel, think, or do nearly anything to accelerate Hell’s victory.
>

>The heavily armored death troopers of Hell, Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.
>
>Dispater rules Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater’s army does the fighting and dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. The imperious Painkillers are full of pride and hubris, and they often obsess over their personal appearance.
>
>Though among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, a Painkiller’s gallantry is twisted. They accept and honor challenges to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere—but if losing, they don’t hesitate to cheat, and if winning, they arrogantly toy with an enemy before finishing them.
>
>In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another world might see their army facing certain defeat and call on Dispater. Ever eager to sow strife and discord, Dispater often responds to these pleas by sending a Painkiller to lead the desperate ruler’s armies.

>The blood-knights of Hell, Sanguine Knights serve Sutekh, Lord of Blood. Their sorceries drain their enemies’ life force, pouring this stolen vitality into infernal rituals to turn the tide of battle.
>
>Sutekh rules Naraka, the City of Blood. Recognized as the greatest sorcerer in hell, he carries the title of High Sanguinary and rules from the Temple of Vitality. He is a master of blood magic, and his inner circle of priests and wizards are the Bloodliches, undead spellcasters whose corporeal forms turned to ash centuries ago and whose bodies are crafted from solid blood.
>
>Sutekh’s illriggers all belong to a cult known as the Chalice of Vitality. Knights of the Chalice drink deeply of their enemies’ essence, draining it to power their magics. Other members of the Order of Desecration fear that the Sanguine Knights seek more than Sutekh’s mere ascension to the Throne of Hell; some whisper that the Chalice secretly schemes to make Sutekh a god. This would, of course, be treason.

>Belial rules Gehennom, the City of Darkness. He strives to rule Hell through poison, torture, and assassination. His illriggers strike from the shadows or use deception to earn high-ranking positions close to powerful rulers. Many Shadowmasters run networks of spies and assassins who have no idea of the infernal provenance of their leader.
>
>Shadowmasters are sworn not to reveal their true allegiance, and if need be, they must take their own lives to fulfill this oath.
